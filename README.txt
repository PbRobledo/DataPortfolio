# Data Analysis Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Analysis Portfolio repository! This collection showcases various data analysis projects that I have worked on. Each project focuses on different aspects of data manipulation, exploratory data analysis, and data visualization.

2. [Data Manipulation and Exploratory Data Analysis](#data-manipulation-and-exploratory-data-analysis)
3. [Data Visualization](#data-visualization)

## Data Cleaning

Description: This section covers projects that involve the cleaning and preprocessing of raw data. Cleaning tasks may include handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing data formats.

## Data Manipulation and Exploratory Data Analysis

Description: In this section, you will find projects that focus on manipulating data to derive meaningful insights. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques are applied to understand data distributions, relationships, and identify patterns.

## Data Visualization

Description: The projects in this section emphasize the creation of visual representations to effectively communicate data insights. Techniques such as using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly are demonstrated to enhance data visualization.

## How to Use This Repository

Each project is contained within its own directory. Within each project directory, you'll find:

- A `README.md` file that provides a detailed overview of the project, its objectives, methodologies, and conclusions.
- Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts containing the code used for the analysis.
- Any necessary data files or sources.

Feel free to explore any project that piques your interest. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Happy exploring!
